Microsoft Project Oxford client SDK and samples
====================================

This repo contains the client libraries and samples that demonstrate the [Microsoft Project
Oxford APIs](<https://www.projectoxford.ai>), an evolving portfolio of REST APIs
that enable developers to leverage the power of Microsoft's natural data
understanding and easily add intelligent services into their solutions. The
Project Oxford APIs are divided into three areas:

-  **[Face APIs](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/face>) (Beta):** See your users with face detection and recognition
-  **[Emotion APIs](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/emotion>) (Beta):** Understand your users with emotion recognition
-  **Video APIs (Coming soon):** Understand and transform your videos


##### Speech
-  **[Speech APIs](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/speech>) (Beta):** Communicate with your users with speech recognition and synthesis powered by Bing
-  **Speaker Recognition APIs (Coming soon):** Recognize your users from their voice 
-  **CRIS, Custom Recognition Intelligent Service (Coming soon):** Customize both language and acoustic models for better speech recognition tailored to your application


##### Language
-  **[Spell Check APIS](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/spellcheck>) (Beta):** Detect and correct common and uncommon spelling errors via the Bing document index
